# data-analysis-group-project
The school group project for the course Statistical Data Analysis.

Our task was to analyze the dataset containing information about the Premier league players' stats from the 2021/22 season.

Using the RStudio framework we ran statistical tests on our given data and made conclusions based on test results.
Methods we used were ANOVA, linear regression, non-parameter ANOVA, t-test etc.

The goal of this project was to learn about both R and the statistical methods taught in class.
